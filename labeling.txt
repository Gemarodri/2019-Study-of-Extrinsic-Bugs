-- HOW TO LABEL EXTRINSIC BUGS --

The curation procedure requires us to understand the bug in detail, which is a non-trivial task.  
In our study we follow the following rules for classifying bug reports as intrinsic or extrinsic.

	A bug report is classified as extrinsic if: 
	(1) It reports a bug caused by a change in the environment where the software is used.
	(2) It reports a bug because requirements have changed.
	(3) It reports a bug caused by an external change to the VCS of the project. 
	(4) It reports a bug in an external library used by the project.
	
  A bug report is classified as intrinsic if:
	(1) There is no evidence to be classified as an extrinsic bug.


-- HOW TO AUTOMATE EXTRINSIC BUGS--

At this point we cannot tell much about how to automate the process, as we have focused on doing it manually.
From our experience, we have seen that automation will not be an easy process: at least the bug description (which is  natural language) 
and the change (which is code) have to be understood.

We believe that this process could be semi-automated, as complete automation will require technology that is not currently available 
[Rodríguez-Pérez, G., Robles, G., Serebrenik, A., Zaidman, A., Germán, D. M., \& Gonzalez-Barahona, J. M. (2020). ``How bugs are born: a model to identify how bugs are introduced in software components''. Empirical Software Engineering, 1-47.]

However, semi-automation to identify extrinsic bugs will require the combination of different techniques and tools. 
For example, natural language processing could be used to understand the bug description, and tools that help researchers to backtrack the modified source code
lines in the bug fixing commit could be applied to understand the code. 
BugVis, a tool that analyzes the evolution of source code lines from their introduction up to their last modification in the bug fixing commit 
[David Bowes, Jean Petric, Tracy Hall, ``BugVis: Commit Slicing for Defect Visualisation", ICPC 2020], could potentially be used as well.
A demo of BugVis can be found in \url{https://youtu.be/ohwMvoZfj1E}. \\

We hope that the result of our manual work can serve as a fold standard for deep learning and natural language processing to develop a 
less human-intensive way to classify extrinsic bugs from their bug description.
